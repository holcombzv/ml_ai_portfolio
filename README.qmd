##### Banco Federal de Financas Marketing Campain Analysis

Me and my team were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of our client's marketing campaign to get customers to subscribe to a term deposit. We were also tasked with creating a decision tree ML model to predict which customers were most likely to subscribe.
